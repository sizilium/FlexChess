# FlexChess
A flexible 3d chess game with variable rules. Rules like board-size, figures and figure capabilities are defined in XML files.
The project comes with 2 AI's, one random generator and one weight based alpha-beta algorithm. Maybe I add https://www.tensorflow.org/ and play around with that.

I just uploaded this old students project for nostalgic reasons.
